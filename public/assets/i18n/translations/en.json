  "project.motivation1": "Vietnam and the world are in the most intense battle again COVID-19. This <1>Ventilator</1> project will alleviate the ongoing shortage of respiratory devices in most health facilities, not only in Vietnam but also in the world. This can contribute a small part in offering the best treatment to patients who are infected with COVID-19.",
  "project.motivation2": "A <1>Ventilator</1> is a medical device that plays an important role in emergency and health assistance. Therefore, we also hope that not only in the COVID-19 but also in life, our project can bring many practical contributions to the community and society.",
